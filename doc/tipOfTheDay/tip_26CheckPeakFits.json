  "header": "<p style=%(para)s>You can check how well your peak fitting has worked by switching the peak symbol to <span style=%(purple)s>Filled Line Widths</span>. Do this either in the Spectrum Display Settings, or by cycling through the different peak symbol options with <span style=%(purple)s>PS</span>. If a peak has been well fit, the filled line widths (at half height) should sit nicely within the contours. Peaks that have not been fitted are shown with a 'flower/snowflake' peak symbol. Fit peaks with shortcut <span style=%(purple)s>RP</span> or fit a group of close or overlapping peaks together with <span style=%(purple)s>RG</span></p>",
