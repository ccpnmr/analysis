This can be useful when peak picking: peaks are only picked on visible contours, and so showing more z-planes can ensure your peak maximum is shown in the Spectrum Display and can thus be picked, rather than being in a plane which is not shown. This may be particularly helpful if your z-dimension is very highly sampled.</p>",
