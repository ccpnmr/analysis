# A macro which will automatically group two NH2 peaks in an HSQC into the same NmrResidue,
# change the NmrAtom names to side chain names and change the NmrResidue type.
# It assumes that the peaks have previously been assigned using Assign / Setup NmrResidues (SN)
#
# To run:
# Select two NH peaks that belong to one NH2 group in an HSQC spectrum and run the macro.
#
# Options:
# If you wish, you can change the new Residue type or Atom names in the top part of the macro.
