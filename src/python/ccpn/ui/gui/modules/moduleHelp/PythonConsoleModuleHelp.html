<h2> Python Console </h2>
    <p><b>The python console allows you to quickly interact with the CCPN API, access and manipulate the data within your project.</b></p>
    <p>CcpNmr Analysis is written as an object-oriented programme. In effect, this means that different types of data (e.g. spectra, peak lists, peaks, chemical shifts, NmrAtoms etc.) automatically have certain properties/attributes and 'subroutines' or functions/methods associated with them. For example, <span class="action">peak.positions</span> would give you the ppm positions of  a peak, or <span class="action">peak.assignDimension(axisCode='H', value=['NA:A.23.ALA.H'])</span> would assign the NmrAtom <span class="action">A.23.ALA.H</span> to the <span class="action">H</span> dimension of a peak. Thus, if you want to write a macro, there are a large number of routines that you can draw on to access and manipulate all the data objects in the programme. So what are the objects and how do I find the methods associated with them?</p>
