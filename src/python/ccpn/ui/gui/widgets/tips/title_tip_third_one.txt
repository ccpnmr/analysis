<p style=%(para)s>
When some words are missing in the pre-defined dictionaries
you can create your own. A custom dictionary is a .dic text
file containing each <span style=%(blue)s>word</span> on a new line. All you have to do
is add the directories where your dictionaries are stored in
<span style=%(red)s> Settings/Preferences | Editor | Spelling.</span>
