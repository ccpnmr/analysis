<h2>Adding Sequences</h2>
    <h3>From a FASTA file</h3>
<p>There are several ways to add Protein, DNA or RNA sequences to your project. The easiest is simply to <span class="action">drag and drop</span> a FASTA file into the sidebar or drop area (make sure the file extension is .fasta). Alternatively, you can go to <span class="action">File / Load Data</span> or <span class="action">Molecules / Chain from FASTA...</span> to select and read in a FASTA file. Analysis will then automatically generate a <span class="action">Chain</span> and <span class="action">Substance</span> for you which will be listed in the sidebar. To change the name of your Substance or the ChainCode, simply <span class="action">double-click</span> on the Substance or Chain in the sidebar and you can make your changes in the <span class="action">Edit Substance</span> or <span class="action">Edit Chain</span> pop-ups.</p>
    <h3>Manual addition of a sequence</h3>
    <p>If you prefer to type or copy & paste your sequence into the program, then you can go to <span class="action">Chain</span> in the sidebar and <span class="action">double-click</span> on <span class="action">New Chain</span> or select <span class="action">New Chain...</span> from the <span class="action">Molecules</span> menu. This brings up a pop-up. Enter the <span class="action">Chain Name</span>, the <span class="action">Molecule Name</span> (this is the name listed under <span class="action">Substances</span> and can be changed later by double-clicking on your <span class="action">Substance</span> in the sidebar), select the <span class="action">Molecule Type</span> (protein, DNA, RNA, other) and set the number at which the sequence starts. </p>
    <p>You can enter your sequence in either the standard <span class="action">One-Letter Code</span> format (<span class="action">A</span> for alanine etc.), the <span class="action">Three-Letter Code</span> format (<span class="action">ALA</span> for alanine etc.) or using the <span class="action">Ccp Code</span> format (<span class="action">Ala</span> for alanine etc.). The sequence can be entered space or comma separated. For 1- and 3-letter codes, the sequence can also be entered as a single string and there is no need to be case sensitive. The sequence will be automatically formatted into blocks of 10 residues with numbering, and any incorrect or unidentified residue types will be highlighted in red with a box around them. Use the two buttons below the sequence entry box to switch the sequence format between a plain text block (orange back arrow) and validated blocks of 10 (refresh arrow with numbers). If you wish, you can <span class="action">right-click</span> on your sequence and select <span class="action">Copy all to Clipboard as 1Letter/3Letter/CcpCodes</span> and then paste this into another tab or elsewhere on your computer. The Ccp Code entry is intended mainly for those working with non-canonical amino acids. See our page on <a href="CreatingChainsWithNoncanonicalAAs.html">Creating Chains with non-canonical amino acids</a> for more information on  this.</p>
    <p>There are then a number of additional options you can select which do the following:</p>
        <ul><span class="action">Add NMR equivalent atoms</span>: This will add Atoms to represent groups of atoms which are NMR-equivalent, e.g. HB% for the alanine methyl atoms HB1, HB2 and HB3 or HDx,HDy,HD%,CDx,CDy,CD% etc. for the Tyr aromatic ring atoms.
            <br><span class="action">Add non-stereospecific atoms</span>: This will add non-stereospecific atoms, e.g. HBx and HBy in addition to HB2 and HB3 for a CH<sub>2</sub> group.
        <br><span class="action">Add extra pseudo-atoms</span>: This will add the IUPAC pseudo-atoms (similar to, but not the same as the <a href="https://cyana.org/wiki/Main_Page">CYANA</a> pseudo-atoms). You are very unlikely ever to need these.
        <br><span class="action">Cyclic Polymer</span>: This will create a peptide bond between your N- and C-terminal residues and make your protein cyclic. This is sometimes the case for small peptides.</ul>
    <p>Once you have <span class="action">clicked OK</span>, your sequence and molecule will show up in the <span class="action">Chains</span> and <span class="action">Substances</span> part of the sidebar. The sequence will also appear in the <span class="action">Residue Information</span> (<span class="action">RI</span>) and  <span class="action">Sequence Graph</span> (<span class="action">SG</span>) modules.</p>
    <p>If your protein or peptide Chain contains non-canonical amino acids, you may wish to look at our page on <a href="CreatingChainsWithNoncanonicalAAs.html">Creating Chains with Non-canonical Amino Acids</a>.</p>
    <h3>Clone a sequence</h3>
    <p>If you are working with a homodimer, you may need to have two Chains of the same protein in your project. You can add an exact copy of a Chain by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on a Chain and selecting <span class="action">Clone</span>. This adds an additional <span class="action">Chain</span>, but no further <span class="action">Substance</span> to your project.</p>
    <h3>Adding a similar sequence</h3>
    <p>If you want to add a second Chain which is similar, but slightly different to an existing one (e.g. a mutant or a slightly longer/shorter construct), then you can <span class="action">right-click</span> on a Chain and select <span class="action">New Chain from selected...</span>. This will open the <span class="action">New Chain</span> pop-up, but will pre-fill it with the sequence and other details from the starting Chain. You can now make any changes you require and create your new Chain. By default, the sequence will be shown in the Ccp Code format, but remember that you can always copy it into 1- or 3-letter format if you wish.</p>
    <p>The <span class="action">New Chain from selected...</span> function is also useful if you made a mistake in your original Chain which you want to correct. At the moment it isn't possible to edit Chains directly, but this function hopefully makes it easy to create a new corrected Chain quickly and easily.</p>
