<h2>Adding Sequences</h2>
<p>There are several ways to add Protein, DNA or RNA sequences to your project. The easiest is simply to <span class="action">drag and drop</span> a FASTA file into the sidebar or drop area. Alternatively, you can go to <span class="action">File / Load Data</span> or <span class="action">Molecules / Chain from FASTA...</span> to select and read in a FASTA file. Analysis will then automatically generate a <span class="action">Chain</span> and <span class="action">Substance</span> for you which will be listed in the sidebar. To change the name of your substance or the chain code, simply <span class="action">double-click</span> on the substance or chain in the sidebar and you can make your changes in the <span class="action">Edit Substance</span> or <span class="action">Edit Chain</span> pop-ups.</p>
<p>If you prefer to type or copy and paste your sequence into the program, then you can go to <span class="action">Chain</span> in the sidebar and <span class="action">double-click</span> on <span class="action">New Chain</span> or select <span class="action">New Chain...</span> from the <span class="action">Molecules</span> menu. You will see a small pop-up where you can type or paste your sequence (in one- or three-letter code in the case of proteins), add a <span class="action">Molecule Name</span> (this is the name listed under substances and can be changed later by double-clicking on your substance), select the numbering at which the sequence starts and choose a chain code. Once you have <span class="action">clicked OK</span>, your sequence will show up in the <span class="action">Chains</span> and <span class="action">Substances</span> part of the sidebar.</p>
<p>To create a second identical chain (for example, if you are working with a dimer), you can <span class="action">right-click</span> on a <span class="action">Chain</span> in the sidebar and choose <span class="action">Clone</span>. This adds an additional <span class="action">Chain</span>, but no further <span class="action">Substance</span>.</p>
