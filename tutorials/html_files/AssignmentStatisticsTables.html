<h2>Assignment Statistics Tables</h2>
<p>The aim of the assignment statistic tables is to allow the calculation of the degree of assignment of a protein chain.
   From this information it can :</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Help identify residues with missing assignments</li>
      <li>Calculate Assignment percentages for atom types</li>
      <li>Identify some potential assignment issues</li>
   </ul>


<h3>Generated tables</h3>

<h3>AssignedChemicalShifts</h3>
   <p>Gives an overview of every chemical shift assigned from a chemical shift list for every possible atom/atom group
      in selected chain, consequently this gives you very large table with a very large number of columns.</p>

   <p><b>Possible values:</b></p>
<ul>
   <li>Chemical shift value recorded for atom/atom group</li>
   <li>empty cells indicate that no data is expected in this location.</li>
   <li>‘ - ‘ data is expected but not available for this for atom/atom group</li>
</ul>

   <h3>AssignmentCompleteness</h3>
   <p>Provides an overview of which atom/atom groups are assigned.</p>

   <p><b>Possible values:</b></p>
<ul>
   <li>Number of observed chemical shifts for this atom/atom group. Both integers and fractions can be observed</li>
   <li>empty cells indicate that no data is expected in this location.</li>
</ul>


   <h3>SummaryAssignment</h3>
   <p>Provides a list of atom types and their percentage assignment coverage.
</p>

   <p><b>Possible values:</b></p>
<ul>
   <li>Number assigned/unassigned</li>
   <li>Percentage assigned</li>
   <li>If no atoms of a type are observed then the percentage column for that value will be empty</li>
</ul>


   <h3>PossibleProblems</h3>
   <p>This table only lists residues, for which recorded chemical shifts number fall outside excepted number.
      For instance, if Ile gamma proton has been recorded for HG1x but not for HG1y, this is listed in the HG
      column as 0.5.<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> currently we do not catch errors such as inconsistent assignment, for instance if Ile HG1y and HG12 are
      both assigned then this will return 1.0</p>

   <p><b>Possible values:</b></p>
<ul>
   <li>Number of observed chemical shifts for this atom/atom group. Both integers and fractions can be observed</li>
   <li>empty cells indicate that no data is expected in this location.</li>
</ul>
