<h2>BMRB Import</h2>
<p>You can import a Chemical Shift List from a BMRB file by <span class="action">dragging</span> an NmrStar file into your project (make sure the file extension .str), going to <span class="action">Project / Import / NmrStar File</span> or typing <span class="action">BI</span>. A pop-up will appear showing whether the BMRB file contains an assigned chemical shift list or not. If it does, this will have a little tick beside it and you can click on <span class="action">Import</span> to import the assigned chemical shifts. This process may take a minute, especially for medium to large sized proteins. When it is finished, your project should contain a new chemical shift list and a new NmrChain containing the NmrResidues and NmrAtoms that are in the new chemical shift list.</p>
<h3>Creating an HSQC Peak List</h3>
<p>If you want to create a peak list from your imported chemical shifts, then you can do so after importing the shift. Go to your imported Chemical Shift List in the sidebar and <span class="action">righ-click</span> and select <span class="action">Simulate Spectrum</span>. Give your new Spectrum a name and then select what type of spectrum you would like it to be. At the moment we are limited to 1D 1H, 2D 1H-15N HSQC, 3D HNCO, 3D HNCA, 3D HNCOCA and 3D HNCACB spectra. Click on <span class="action">Create</span> and the program will create a new dummy spectrum with your chosen name. This contains the peak list from the imported chemical shift list. You can copy this peak list to a real spectrum, simply by dragging it onto that Spectrum in a SpectrumDisplay. Later you can delete the dummy spectrum if you like. If desired, you can make your new imported peak list distinct by changing its colour: simply <span class="action">double-click</span> on the peak list in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Peak List Properties</span> dialog and choose new colours for the peak symbols and labels.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>Not all BMRB files are in the latest 3.2 NmrStar format. Some files are still in the 3.1.1 format which stops the assigned chemical shift lists from being recognised by CcpNmr Analysis. (The NmrStar version a BMRB file is in is indicated near the top of the file.) A fix for this is to make a couple of manual adjustments to the file following the examples below:</p>
<p>Find the <span class="action">Assigned chemical shift lists</span> section of the file. Near the start of this section change the highlighted parts of following three lines from something like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><i><span class="action">save_chemical_shift_assignment_data_set_one</span>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_category &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;assigned_chemical_shifts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_framecode &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="action">'chemical_shift_assignment_data_set_one'</span></i>
</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><i><span class="action">save_assigned_chem_shift_list_1</span>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_category &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;assigned_chemical_shifts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_framecode &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="action">assigned_chem_shift_list_1</span></i>
</p>
<p>Or they may look something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><i><span class="action">save_chem_shift_list_1</span>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_category &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;assigned_chemical_shifts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_framecode &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="action">chem_shift_list_1</span></i>
</p>
<p>In which case, change them to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><i><span class="action">save_assigned_chem_shift_list_1</span>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_category &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;assigned_chemical_shifts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_framecode &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="action">assigned_chem_shift_list_1</span></i>
</p>
<p>The chemical shift list import should now work.</p>
