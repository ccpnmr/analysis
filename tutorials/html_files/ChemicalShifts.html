    <h2>Chemical Shifts</h2>
    <h4>Note that this is new for Version 3.1 - in Version 3.0 the Chemical Shifts are handled slightly differently</h4>
    <p>Each project always has to contain at least one Chemical Shift List. New projects are given one called <span class="action">default</span>.</p>
    <h3>The link between Spectra and Chemical Shift Lists</h3>
    <p>Each spectrum has to be associated with one Chemical Shift List. When you open a new spectrum, it will by default be associated with the first Chemical Shift List in your project (usually the <span class="action">default</span> list). If you <span class="action">double-click</span> on a spectrum in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog box, you can see in the <span class="action">General</span> tab which <span class="action">Chemical Shift List</span> the Spectrum is associated with. You can also change which Chemical Shift List this is (including creating a new Chemical Shift List) using the drop-down menu.</p>
    <p>An alternative way to manipulate the link between a Spectrum and a Chemical Shift List, is to <span class="action">double-click</span> on a Chemical Shift List in the sidebar. This will show you which spectra are associated with this Chemical Shift List and which are not. You can <span class="action">drag</span> spectra between the <span class="action">Not Included</span> and <span class="action">Included</span> boxes to change which spectra belong to that Chemical Shift List (or <span class="action">double-click</span> on a spectrum to move it to the other box). If you only have one Chemical Shift List in your project, you will not be able to exclude spectra from this. If you move spectra out of the current Chemical Shift List, then they will by default go into the top or next available Chemical Shift List.</p>
    <p>When you assign peaks in a spectrum, then the NmrAtoms used for the assignment will be added to the Chemical Shift List of that spectrum. The Chemical Shift value for any one NmrAtom will then be automatically averaged over all the Peaks it has been assigned to in Spectra which are linked to that Chemical Shift List. We refer to these Chemical Shifts as being <span class="action">dynamic</span> because they change dynamically as you assign and deassign peaks in the linked spectra.</p>
    <p>If a Chemical Shift for a particular NmrAtom was added to a Chemical Shift List, but later the assignment is removed (i.e. the NmrAtom is no longer being used for any peak assignments), then the Chemical Shift remains in the list, but it is marked as being <span class="action">orphaned</span> because it no longer has a link to any peaks. It's Chemical Shift value is simply the last value it had. Note that when you <a href="NefExportForBmrbDeposition.html">export a NEF file</a> from your project you can choose whether or not to <span class="action">include ChemicalShift orphans</span>. Usually you will not want to export these as they are often simply the remnants of incorrect or temporary assignments.</p>
    <h3>When should I use multiple Chemical Shift Lists?</h3>
    <p>You should use additional Chemical Shift Lists any time you add spectra to your project which are recorded under different conditions resulting in (potentially) changed chemical shifts. So if you record some spectra at a different temperature, a different pH or including different concentrations of a ligand or binding partner, then you should use a different Chemical Shift List. So for a titration, each of your spectra should (ideally) be in a separate Chemical Shift List. Otherwise, your Chemical shifts will be average across all the spectra in the titration. If you did not put them in different Chemical Shift Lists, the chemical shifts of the peaks that move will contribute towards the chemical shift of that NmrAtom. And when you go to deposit your Chemical Shift List, some of your chemical shifts might be distorted!</p>
    <h3>Duplicating and Importing Chemical Shift Lists</h3>
    <p>You can duplicate a Chemical Shift List by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on it in the sidebar and selecting <span class="action">Duplicate</span>. This will give you a snap-shot of your Chemical Shift List at that point in time and because the List isn't associated with any spectra, the Chemical Shifts in it won't change as you manipulate the peaks in your spectra. We refer to the chemical shifts in such a list (which doesn't have any spectra associated with it) as being <span class="action">static</span> because they won't change.</p>
    <p>In a similar way, you can import a Chemical Shift List from a BMRB NMRStar or NEF file and then that Chemical Shift List will also not be associated with any spectra and have <span class="action">static</span> Chemical Shifts.</p>
    <p>If you later associate a spectrum with a Chemical Shift List of this type, then chemical shifts all become <span class="action">dynamic</span> as they can now be automatically altered through peak assignments and deassignments.</p>
    <h3>Dynamic, Static and Orphaned Chemical Shifts</h3>
    <p><span class="action">Dynamic</span> Chemical Shifts are in a Chemical Shift List which is linked to at least one spectrum. <span class="action">Static</span> Chemical Shifts are in a Chemical Shift List which is not linked to any spectra. A <span class="action">dynamic</span> chemical shift is <span class="action">orphaned</span> if its NmrAtom is not used for any peak assignments in the linked spectra.</p>
    <p>If you would like to see whether your Chemical Shifts are <span class="action">dynamic</span> or <span class="action">static</span> or if any of your <span class="action">dynamic</span> Chemical Shifts are <span class="action">orphaned</span>, you can open a Chemical Shift Table (<span class="action">drag</span> it into the Drop Area from the sidebar, or <span class="action">right-click</span> in the sidebar and select <span class="action">Open as Module</span>) and then <span class="action">right-click</span> on a column heading and select <span class="action">Column Settings...</span>. You can then select to view the <span class="action">State</span> and <span class="action">Orphaned</span> columns to see if your Chemical Shifts are  <span class="action">dynamic</span> or <span class="action">static</span>. A tick in the <span class="action">Orphaned</span> column indicates that a <span class="action">dynamic</span> Chemical Shift is <span class="action">orphaned</span>.</p>
