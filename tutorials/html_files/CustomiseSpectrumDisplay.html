<h2>Customise Spectrum Display</h2>
<h3>Background Colour</h3>
    <p>You can set the background of your spectra to be either white or black. Go to <span class="action">File / Preferences ...</span> or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span> and towards the bottom of the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab you can select your <span class="action">Spectrum Display background</span> to be either <span class="action">light</span> (for a white background) or <span class="action">dark</span> for a black background. Axis/mouse colours and contour colours for newly loaded spectra will adjust automatically. Selecting <span class="action">Autocorrect colours</span> will additionally change the colours of all the spectra in your project to their inverse so that they will be better visible. The chosen colour scheme will be active across all your projects.</p>
<h3>Contours</h3>
<p>You can adjust the contour levels of a spectrum using the <span class="action">Contours Up/Down</span> buttons in the toolbar. To set the contour levels manually, either <span class="action">double-click</span> on a spectrum in the sidebar and go to the <span class="action">Contours</span> tab in the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog box, or <span class="action">right-click</span> in your spectrum and select <span class="action">Contours ...</span> to set the contours for all spectra in that display.
<br>The Contours diaglog lets you set the contour base levels manually. You can also set the multiplier; this determines how close to one another the contours are drawn. Go for 1.1-1.2 to make them very close, or 1.6-1.8 to separate them out more. You can also change the number and colour of the contours and select whether or not to show the positive/negative contours. You can add custom colours by clicking on the colour button. Make sure you select the box you want to place your new custom colour in before adding it, or you will overwrite the first custom colour. Custom colours are stored in your global preferences and will be available to you in other projects.</p>
<p>If you have multiple spectra in one display, you can switch the spectra on/off using the buttons in the spectrum toolbar. You can show/hide the spectrum toolbar by typing <span class="action">SB</span> or <span class="action">right-clicking</span> and toggling <span class="action">Spectrum Toolbar</span> on/off. (You can hide the main toolbar with <span class="action">TB</span> or <span class="action">right-click / Toolbar</span>.)
<br>You can remove a spectrum from a display by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on the spectrum botton in the toolbar and selecting <span class="action">Remove Spectrum</span>. Add it again by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> it into the module from the sidebar.</p>
<h3>Crosshairs and Gridlines</h3>
<p>You can toggle mouse crosshairs on and off using <span class="action">CH</span> or by going to <span class="action">right mouse menu / Customise: / Crosshair</span>. You can toggle a double crosshair mode for the mouse on and off using <span class="action">CD</span> or <span class="action">right mouse menu / Customise: / Double Crosshair</span>. The double crosshair mode will give you crosshairs on both sides of a diagonal.
<br>You can add or remove gridlines to/from your spectrum display by typing <span class="action">GS</span> or going to <span class="action">right mouse menu / Customise: / Gridlines</span>.
<br>You can change your default preferences for the crosshair and gridline options by going to the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab in <span class="action">File / Preferences ...</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd,</span> to bring up the <span class="action">Preferences</span> dialog box). These will then be the defaults when you open or create another project.</p>
<h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
<p>You can change the aspect ratio of a spectrum by <span class="action">scrolling the mouse-wheel</span> on one of the axes. This selectively zooms that axis and has the effect of changing the aspect ratio. To lock the aspect ratio <span class="action">left-click</span> on <span class="action">Locked</span> in the bottom left-hand corner of the spectrum display. Clicking on <span class="action">Fixed</span> will set the aspect ratio a fixed setting set in your Preferences. You can also change the Fixed aspect ratio for a single Spectrum Display in the <span class="action">Settings</span> panel. See <a href="Zooming.html">Zooming</a> for more information on aspect ratios and zooming.</p>
<h3>Flipping Spectra</h3>
<p>If you would like to display your spectrum with a different arrangement of axes, then you can type <span class="action">XY</span>, <span class="action">XZ</span> or <span class="action">YZ</span> to swap those axes. A new module with the new axis arrangement will open up. For more information on flipping spectra and how to set default axis arrangements see <a href="FlippingSpectra.html">Flipping Spectra</a>.</p>
