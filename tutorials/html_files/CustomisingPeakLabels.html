<h2>Customising Peak Labels</h2>
<p>You can type <span class="action">PL</span> or go to <span class="action">right-click / Cycle Peak Lables</span> to cycle through four different peak label display options:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><b>Short</b>: Residue Type, Residue Number and Atom Name, compressed where dimensions are the same, e.g. <span class="action">G28H, N</span> or <span class="action">@92H, N</span> or <span class="action">G28H, N; A27CA</span>
<br><b>Full</b>: Residue Type, Residue Number and Atom Name for all dimensions, e.g. <span class="action">G28H, G28N</span> or <span class="action">@92H, @92N</span> or <span class="action">G28H, G28N; A27CA</span>
<br><b>Pid</b>: Project ID (Chain.ResidueNumber.ResidueType.AtomName), e.g. <span class="action">A.28.GLY.H, N</span> or <span class="action">@-.@92..H, N</span> or <span class="action">A.28.GLY.H, N; A.ALA.27.CA</span>
<br><b>Minimal</b>: Residue Type and Number, e.g.<span class="action">G28</span> or <span class="action">@92</span> or <span class="action">G28; A27</span></p>
<p>You can set your preferred default peak labels in <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>) in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab under <span class="action">Peak Annotations</span>.</p>
<p>Peak symbols can be changed by typing <span class="action">PS</span> or going to <span class="action">right-click / Cycle Peak Symbols</span>. Again there are four options which you can cycle through:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><b>Cross</b>: <span class="action">X</span>
<br><b>Line widths</b>: these are drawn as closed ellipses if the line width has been determined or dotted ellipses if the line width is unknown.
<br><b>Filled line widths</b>: these are drawn as filled ellipses if the line width has been determined or flower/star-style ellipses if the line width is unknown.
<br><b>Plus</b>: <span class="action">+</span> </p>
<p>Again, your preferred default peak symbol can be set in <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>) in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab under <span class="action">Symbols</span>. You can also set your default symbol size and thickness here.</p>
<p>An alternative way to set peak labels and symbols is to <span class="action">click on the gear icon</span> of a display module and then select the options desired, including symbol size and thickness. Note, therefore, that these features are properties of the display rather than of an individual peak list.</p>
<p>Peaks can be hidden/shown by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on a <span class="action">spectrum button</span> in the <span class="action">Spectrum toolbar</span>. Under <span class="action">Peak Lists</span> you can show/hide the peaks belonging to one or all of the peak lists associated with that spectrum.</p>
<p>The colour of both the peak labels and the peak symbols can be changed and are properties of the peak list which the peaks belong to. To change the peak label and symbol colour, <span class="action">double-click</span> on a peak list in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Peak List Properties</span> dialog and select the colours of your choice.</p>
