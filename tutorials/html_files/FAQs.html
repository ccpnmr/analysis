<h3 id="V2Feat">What has happened to my favourite Version 2 features?</h3></p>
<p>Have a look at our <a href="PopularV2FeaturesInV3.html">Popular V2 Features in V3</a> page for a list of V2 features and how they have been implemented in V3. You may also be interested in our <a href="V2ToV3Translation.html">V2 to V3 translation</a> page which gives a direct translation of V2 mouse and keyboard commands to the new V3 commands.</p>

<h3 id="ShouldISwitch">Should I switch from Version 2 to Version 3?</h3>
<p>Overall, V3 is a nicer, more flexible and more user-friendly programme than V2.4, as illustrated in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k08ZwgZY8yA&t=914s">Switching to CcpNmr Analysis V3</a> talk from our 2019 conference. However, as yet, not all features have been ported from V2.4. Our <a href="PopularV2FeaturesInV3.html">Popular V2 Features in V3</a> page will give you a bit of an idea of whether there are elements of V2.4 that are not yet present in V3 and that you don't want to do without. In general, smaller projects involving assignments and chemical shift mapping will work well in V3. Anything involving structures, relaxation data analysis and regular use of synthetic peaks lists is currently better served in V2.4.</p>

<h3 id="V2toV3">Can I open Version 2 projects in Version 3?</h3>
<p>Yes! This is very easy - Version 2 projects can be opened directly in Version 3. See our <a href="ImportingV2Projects.html">Importing V2 Projects</a> tutorial on how to do this. The only caveat is if your V2 project uses labelling schemes, then at the moment you will have to do a small work-around shown in <a href="https://youtu.be/Cz-DwGuAurY">this video</a>.</p>

<h3 id="V3toV2">Can I open Version 3 projects in Version 2?</h3>
<p>Yes, but with some caveats. You will need to save the Version 3 project as a NEF file: go to <span class="action">Project / Export / NEF File</span> or type <span class="action">EX</span> and save everything with CCPN tags. You can then import the NEF file into Version 2.5 (not 2.4!) by going to <span class="action">Project / Load NEF</span>.
<br>Please be aware that this process is not foolproof as Version 3 contains features not contained in Version 2. In particular, you are likely to encounter problems if your project contains molecules that are not simply proteins made up of natural amino acids. Similarly, labelling is handled very differently, and any explicit labelling of molecules in Version 3 may cause problems when going back to Version 2.</p>

<h3 id="RemoteWorking">Can I use CcpNmr Analysis remotely?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. We strongly recommend that you have your project on a local disk. This is because Analysis regularly writes to your project files and is currently not set up to deal with temporary breaks in the connection. You could therefore easily end up with your project in a compromised state which will later make it unreadable. However, if your spectrum files (which are generally what takes up lots of disk space) are on a remote disk/server, then that is fine. Analysis only has to read these files and so there shouldn't be any issues.
<br>Finally, you can of course also log into a different machine through VNC Viewer (e.g. to <a href="https://nmrbox.org/">NMRBox</a>), TeamViewer or some other such package and work on a remote workstation. In this case, it is simply the graphics which are being relayed back to your local computer. The important thing is that your project is stored on the same computer on which are running CcpNmr Analysis.</p>


<h3 id="ChemBuildMol">How can I get a molecule from ChemBuild into CcpNmr Analysis V3?</h3>
<p>As yet, ChemBuild and Analysis V3 are not properly integrated and it may still take us a little while to get this done properly. There are one or two workarounds. Which one you should use (and indeed whether you should bother importing a molecule at all!)  depends on what your ultimate aim is (why are you trying to import what).</p>
<p>Analysis V3 is currently able to read pdb files and SMILES, but not the CCPN ChemComp .xml files and not mol2 files.
    <br>pdb files can simply be dragged in, and will then go into the <span class="action">Structural Ensemble</span> part of the data structure (note that currently only ATOM and not HETATM lines are recognised/read in). Once a pdb file has been read in, there is not much you can do with it at the moment. Generating an NmrChain from a Structural Model is on our ToDo list, though.
    <br>SMILES notations (not files) can be entered in the <span class="action">Substances</span> section:
    <li>double-click on <span class="action">New Substance</span> under <span class="action">Substances</span> in the sidebar</li>
    <li>click on <span class="action">Show more</span></li>
<li>copy/paste your SMILES into the <span class="action">Smiles box</span></li>
<li>click <span class="action">Apply</span> or <span class="action">OK</span> and the molecule will be added</li>
<br>ChemBuild will write pdb files, but not SMILES. If you want your ChemBuild molecule in SMILES notation, you will have to export it as mol2 and then use <a href="http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenBabel</a> to convert it to SMILES.</p>
<p>Now on to thinking about why you want to import something from ChemBuild into V3 and the implications for what you might want (and be able) to do:
<ol><li>If you are wanting to import a small molecule (i.e. not a protein, peptide or DNA/RNA), then you are best off importing your molecules as a SMILES. You can then generate an NmrChain from your substance (double-click on <span class="action">New NmrChain</span> and select <span class="action">Clone from Substance</span>). You can then assign your molecule using the NmrAtoms in that NmrChain (the molecule will go into a single NmrResidue in the NmrChain).</li>
    <li>If you have a non-standard amino acid in your peptide/protein, the easiest thing is probably to enter the chain using the natural amino acid most closely related to your non-natural one. Create an NmrChain from your Chain (double-click on <span class="action">New NmrChain</span> and select <span class="action">Clone from Chain</span>). Then delete/add NmrAtoms to the natural amino acid to create your non-natural amino acid. You can then use the NmrAtoms to do your assignment. The only drawback with this is that the program will not be able to recognise your non-natural amino acid as being assigned, because there is no equivalent in a Chain. At the moment it isn't possible to modify Chains (except to delete residues), but we will be adding such features in future.</li></ol></p>
<p>What is worth noting is that you can make quite a few changes to your NmrChains and NmrResidues (by double-clicking on them in the sidebar). So you can import a SMILES as a substance, create an NmrChain from this (the whole molecule will go into a single NmrResidue) and then double-click on the <span class="action">NmrResidue</span> and change the NmrChain, Sequence Code (i.e. Residue Number) and Amino Acid name to those of your choice, and this will be slotted into another NmrChain. (So, in this way, you could have another NmrChain in which you had removed an NmrResidue and then you could replace it with something from a SMILES.)
