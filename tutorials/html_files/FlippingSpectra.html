<h2>Flipping Spectra</h2>
<p>The axes in 2D and 3D spectra can easily be flipped by typing <span class="action">XY</span>, <span class="action">XZ</span> or <span class="action">YZ</span> to flip the axes in question. You can also go to the <span class="action">View</span> menu and select <span class="action">In Active Spectrum Display / ..with X-Y Axes flipped</span> (and the equivalents for the other axes). Because each spectrum display module has a fixed arrangement of axes, the spectrum is not flipped within a module, instead a new module with flipped axes is opened. The original module can then be retained or closed, as desired.</p>
<p>An alternative, which also works well for 4D and higher dimensionality spectra, is to type <span class="action">FA</span> (for 'flip axes') or go to the <span class="action">View</span> menu and select <span class="action">In Active Spectrum Display / ..with Axes flipped...</span>. This will bring up a small dialog box in which you can select the axis ordering to which you would to move.</p>
<p>The default axis arrangement is to keep the directly detected dimension on the X-axis, place any dimension with the same isotope code on the Y-axis and the remaining dimension along the Z-axis. Triple resonance spectra are displayed in an HxCyNz arrangement. You can change the default axis arrangment for a spectrum by <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on the spectrum in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog. Move to the <span class="action">Dimensions</span> tab and select your <span class="action">Preferred Dimension Ordering</span>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can go to the global preferences in <span class="action">File / Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>). In the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab you can change the <span class="action">Displayed Axis Order</span> from <span class="action">Use spectrum settings</span> to <span class="action">Always ask</span>. In this case, whenever you open a spectrum in a new Spectrum Display module, you will be asked what axis arrangement you would like to use.</p>
