<h2>Forum Registration</h2>
<p>We felt it would be helpful to keep queries about CcpNmr Analysis V2 and V3 separate. But rather than creating a new JISC e-mail list, we have set up a Forum for V3 queries.</p>
<p>You can register very quickly and easily by clicking on <span class="action">Register</span> and you can select to stay logged in, so you don't have to keep entering your password (or store the password in your browser/password manager system).</p>
<p>If you would like the forum essentially to function like an e-mail list, then make sure you select <span class="action">Instant e-mail notification</span> as your <span class="action">Default Thread Subscription Mode</span> and <span class="action">Subrscribe to all new threads and posts</span> under <span class="action">Automatic subscriptions</span> during the registration process (you can also do this later if you forget - go to <span class="action">User CP</span> and select <span class="action">Edit Options</span> in the <span class="action">Your Profile</span> section of the left-hand menu). This way you will receive an e-mail each time a new thread is posted. If you ignore the e-mail you won't receive anything more on that thread. If you do go and have a look at the thread and any replies, you will be e-mailed all future replies on that thread.</p>
<p>Once you have confirmed your e-mail address your registation is complete and you can start a new thread or post replies. When posting something, we recommend you select <span class="action">Subscribe and receive email notification of new replies</span> to make sure you stay informed of any replies.</p>
