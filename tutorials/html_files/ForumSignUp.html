    <h2>Forum Sign Up</h2>
    <p>You can find the CCPN forum at <a href="https://forum.ccpn.ac.uk/">forum.ccpn.ac.uk</a> (and the old link should also redirect you there).</p>
    <p>Anyone can read posts, but if you would like to post something yourself, or receive posts as e-mails, you will need to sign up. Click on <span class="action">Sign Up</span> and then enter your email address, a username, optionally your name, and a password. We also ask you to confirm that you have read our <a href="https://ccpn.ac.uk/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> which essentially states that we collect the minimal amount of data that we need, don’t share it with anyone and that you can delete or have your account anonymised at any time. As part of GDPR compliance we also ask you to confirm that you know that we will be sending you emails as part of the Forum. See Account Customisation below for ways to configure what types of emails you would like to receive. </p>
    <h3>Account Activation</h3>
    <p>After Signing up you will receive an e-mail with a link you need click on to confirm your e-mail address and activate your account and then one of the Forum Administrators will need to approve you. If you sign up with an academic e-mail address, approval will be quicker and easier. And if you are not on a European timezone or it’s the weekend, you may have to wait a day or so for approval. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail and will be able to log in to the forum.</p>
    <h3>Account Customisation</h3>
    <p>Once you have logged in, you can customise your account by going to your user icon and then selecting the user tab and going to <span class="action">Preferences</span>. Of particular note are the options under <span class="action">Emails</span> which allow you to set enable <span class="action">Mailing List mode</span>. This way you will receive all posts as e-mails and can reply to them directly by e-mail. Under <span class="action">Notifications</span> you can set various options, including whether to receive live notifications or allow other users to send you personal messages or not.</p>
    <p> You can find information about creating posts and using the forum under <a href="ForumUsage.html">Forum Usage</a>.</p>
