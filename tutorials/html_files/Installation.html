<h2>Command Line Installation on Mac or Linux</h2>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can download the software from our website at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><a href="https://ccpn.ac.uk/software/downloads/">https://ccpn.ac.uk/software/downloads/</a></p>
<p>which should always provide you with the most recent version.</p>
<p>Using the tabs, locate either the Mac or Linux download files.</p>
<h3>Installation using the command line</h3>
<p>Once you have downloaded the program, unpack it in a directory of your choice (in this case it is ~/Programs). There are numerous ways to do this. One of them would be something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>cd ~/Programs
<br>mv ~/Downloads/download_file.zip .
<br>unzip download_file.zip</b></p>
<p>or you can do all of this in a file browser.</p>
<p>The unpacking may take a minute or two. Once it is finished you should have a directory called something like ccpnmr3.1.0 (depending on the exact version you have downloaded).</p>
<h3>Starting the program</h3>
<p>The executable files are located in the ccpnmr3.1.0/bin directory, so you can start the program with something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>cd ccpnmr3.1.0/bin
<br>./assign</b></p>
<p>Depending on what shell you are using, you could set up an alias in your .cshrc file with the line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>alias assign '~/Programs/ccpnmr3.1.0/bin/assign'</b></p>
<p>or in your .bashrc file with the line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>alias assign='~/Programs/ccpnmr3.1.0/bin/assign'</b></p>
<p>Remember these will only become active if you source your .cshrc/.bashrc file or open new terminal window. Then you can start CcpNmr AnalysisAssign simply by typing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;  color:#803594";><b>assign</b></p>
<p>at any point in a terminal.</p>
<p>You should now make sure that you <a href="InstallingUpdates.html">Install Updates</a>.</p>
    <h3>Structure, Screen and Metbolomics</h3>
    <p>If you would like to use the Structure, Screen or Metabolomics programs, then you will need to start the program with one of the following commands:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>./structure
    <br>./screen
    <br>./metabolomics</b></p>
<p>The <span class="action">bin</span> directory also contains the executables <span class="action">chemBuild</span> which will start the ChemBuild program, <span class="action">update</span> which will apply the latest updates from our server without actually opening the program itself and <span class="action">analysisassign, analysismetabolomics, analysisscreen and analysisstructure</span> which may be useful for those people who find that they have name clashes with other programs called assign, screen or structure.</p>
