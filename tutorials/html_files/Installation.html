<h2>Installation on Mac or Linux</h2>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can download the software from our website at</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/v3-software/downloads">https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/v3-software/downloads</a></p>
<p>and then go to the most recent version.</p>
<p>If you scroll down you will find both the Mac and the Linux download files. The Mac download does not include the tutorials and example data, so you will have to download this separately, if you would like have it. The Linux download already includes the tutorial and example data.</p>
<h3>Installation using the command line</h3>
<p>Once you have downloaded the program, unpack it in a directory of your choice (in this case it is ~/Applications). There are numerous ways to do this. One of them would be something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>cd ~/Applications
<br>mv ~/Downloads/download_file.zip .
<br>unzip download_file.zip</b></p>
<p>for a .zip file or to extract a .tgz file use the following command in the final line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>tar xvzf download_file.zip</b></p>
<p>The unpacking may take a minute or two. Once it is finished you should have a directory called something like ccpnmr3.0.0 (depending on the exact version you have downloaded).</p>
<h3>Starting the program</h3>
<p>The executable file is located in the ccpnmr3.0.0/bin directory, so you can start the program with something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>cd ccpnmr3.0.0/bin
<br>./assign</b></p>
<p>Depending on what shell you are using, you could set up an alias in your .cshrc file with the line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>alias assign '~/Applications/ccpnmr3.0.0/bin/assign'</b></p>
<p>or in your .bashrc file with the line</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; color:#803594";><b>alias assign='~/Applications/ccpnmr3.0.0/bin/assign'</b></p>
<p>Remember these will only become active if you source your .cshrc/.bashrc file or open new terminal window. Then you can start CcpNmr AnalysisAssign simply by typing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;  color:#803594";><b>assign</b></p>
<p>at any point in a terminal.</p>
<p>You should now make sure that you <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=23">Install Updates</a>.</p>
