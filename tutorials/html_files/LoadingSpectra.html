<h2>Loading Spectra</h2>
<p>You can load a spectrum by <span class="action">dragging and dropping</span>  a spectrum file from your computer's file browser into the drop area or onto the sidebar. If you drag it into the drop area, it will open immediately and it will be listed under <span class="action">Spectra</span> in the sidebar. If you drag your file onto the sidebar, it will be visible there, but not open in the display/drop area. You can drag and drop multiple spectra in one go.</p>
<p>You can also load a spectrum by going to <span class="action">Spectrum / Load Spectrum...</span> in the main menu or typing <span class="action">LS</span>. This will bring up a dialog box in which you can select your spectum file. You can only open one spectrum at a time this way.</p>
<h3>Displaying Spectra</h3>
<p>To display a spectrum in the drop area, either <span class="action">left-drag</span> it from the sidebar into the drop area or <span class="action">right-click</span> on it and select <span class="action">Open as Module</span>. If the drop area is emtpy, you can drag your spectrum to any part of the drop area to display it. If another module is already open in the display area, you need to drag the spectrum to an edge of the display area and drop it when you see a purple box appear. See <a href="WorkingWithModules.html">Working with Modules</a> for more information on arranging multiple modules in your drop area.</p>
<p>Each spectrum display module can display multiple spectra, but the isotopes of the axes must match. To add a spectrum to a module, simply <span class="action">left-drag</span> it into the module (if the axes don't match nothing will happen). See Customise Spectrum Display to find out more about displaying spectra.</p>
<h3>Data Formats / File Types</h3>
<p>All previously supported file types can be read into CcpNmr Analysis: Azara, Bruker, Felix, NmrPipe, NmrView, UCSF, Varian and Factorised.</p>
<p><b>Bruker data:</b> Please note that in order to open Bruker data correctly, Analysis needs to be able to read several files and not just the 2rr/3rrr file. You can drag and drop the 2rr/3rrr file (or the procs file) into Analysis to open the spectrum, but they must be contained within the Bruker file structure so that Analysis can access the other files it needs to read and display the data correctly. We often recommend converting Bruker data to UCSF data (you can do this using the bruk2ucsf script that is distributed with <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/">Sparky</a> - <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/manual/files.html#ConvertBruker">see here for more information</a>) rather than reading it directly into Analysis. If you are working with large 3D data sets, then the Bruker data format can be rather slower than other data formats. It also has the disadvantage that if you want to try reprocessing your data, you will overwrite your data file which could mean that your peaks no longer match your spectrum!</p>
