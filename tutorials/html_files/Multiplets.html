<h2>Multiplets</h2>
    <h3>Adding Multiplets</h3>
    <p>You can add multiplets by picking and selecting the peaks that make up a multiplet. Then either <span class="action">right-click</span> on one of the peaks and select <span class="action">New Mutliplet</span> or use the keyboard shortcut <span class="action">AM</span>. Multiplets are shown by a cross with a circle round it and lines linking it to all constituent peaks. A multiplet's chemical shifts are simply the averages of the chemical shifts of its constituent peaks. Multiplets can be added to any 1D or ND spectrum.</p>
    <h3>Marking Multiplets</h3>
    <p>You can place marks through one or more selected multiplets either by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on one and selecting <span class="action">Mark Multiplets</span> or with the shortcut <span class="action">UM</span>. The shortcuts <span class="action">UX</span>, <span class="action">UY</span>, <span class="action">UZ</span> and <span class="action">UW</span> will place marks only along the X, Y, Z(1) and Z2 axes of the selected multiplets. </p>
    <h3>Multiplet Lists</h3>
    <p>Multiplet lists are nested below spectra along with Peak Lists. Open a multiplet list by dragging it into the drop area. On the left-hand side you will see a list of the multiplets and on the right a list of the peaks making up the selected multiplet(s). You can select multiplets and peaks as normal. Selecting them in the table also selects them in your spectra and you can <span class="action">double-click</span> on any of them to navigate to that position in your spectra.</p>
    <h3>Selecting the peaks in a multiplet</h3>
    <p>By double-clicking on a multiplet in a spectrum (or several if also holding down the <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd</span> key) you will select all the constituent peaks. This can be useful if you want to assign/label all peaks the same way in one go in the Peak Assigner. Note that if the Peak Assigner tells you that the peaks diverge, you may have to increase your <span class="action">Assignment Tolerances</span> in the <span class="action">Dimensions</span> tab of your <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog (open this by <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on the spectrum in the sidebar).</p>
