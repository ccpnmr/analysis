<h2>Peak Picking</h2>
<h3>Peak pick selected area</h3>
<p>To pick the peaks in a particular area, hold down <span class="action">Shift</span> and <span class="action">Ctrl</span> (<span class="action">Cmd</span> on a Mac) while <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the mouse. A blue box will be drawn and peaks will be picked at all visible extrema (maxima and minima) in that area. If you find you are picking too many or too few peaks, adjust your contour levels and remember to show/hide positive/negative contours depending on which you would like to have picked. For more information on adjusting contour levels, go to <a href="CustomiseSpectrumDisplay.html">Customise Spectrum Display</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can type <span class="action">PP</span> or go to <span class="action">Spectrum / Pick Peaks / Pick ND Peaks...</span>. A pop-up will appear in which you can select the area in which you would like to pick peaks (by default the whole spectrum area is included). Choose whether to pick positive or negative peaks or both and click on <span class="action">Find Peaks</span> to pick your peaks.</p>
<h3>Manual peak pick</h3>
<p>Press <span class="action">Shift</span> and <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd</span> while <span class="action">left-clicking</span> the mouse where you would like to place your peak.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can type <span class="action">MM</span> and the mouse will go into peak picking mode. You can now easily place multiple peaks in various places in quick succession. Type <span class="action">MM</span> again to exit the peak picking mouse mode.</p>
<p>If you would like to snap any manually placed peaks to their closest extrama (maximum or minimum), simply select them and type <span class="action">SE</span>.</p>
<h3>Peak picking in 3D spectra</h3>
<p>This is the same as peak picking in 2D spectra, but be aware that if you are not in the plane containing the maximum or minimum of your peak, <span class="action">Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + left-dragging</span> to pick a peak may not work. Move planes until you think you are near the maximum and try again, or place a peak maually and type <span class="action">SE</span>. Navigate to the correct plane to find the peak on the peak extremum.</p>
<p>It is also possible to peak pick a 3D spectrum based on its 2D root spectrum. This will be described elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Peak picking parameters</h3>
<p>In the Project Preferences (go to <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd + ,</span>) in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab you will find the <span class="action">Peak Picking Drop</span> parameter. This is the percentage by which a peak must drop off from its maximum in all directions (or rise from its minimum) in order to be recognised as a peak. The higher this value, the less likely you are to pick partially overlapped peaks or peaks with shoulders on them.</p>
