    <h2>Printing to File</h2>
    <p>Printing to File will let you create an image of a Spectrum Display or Strip in <span class="action">.pdf</span>, <span class="action">.png</span>, <span class="action">.ps</span> or <span class="action">.svg</span> format. Go to <span class="action">Spectrum / Print to File</span> and then <span class="action">Print to File...</span> or use the shortcut <span class="action">Ctrl+P</span> (<span class="action">Cmd+P</span> on a Mac).</p>
    <h3>Basic Options</h3>
    <p>You can select which Spectrum Display or individual Strip you would like to print followed by your <span class="action">Page Size</span>, <span class="action">Orientation</span> and <span class="action">File type</span>. The <span class="action">Foreground colour</span> is the colour for all the lines, axes etc., the <span class="action">Background Colour</span> will be the background to the contours. So you can choose what colour background you would like for your image, regardless of background you use on screen. The <span class="action">Strip Padding</span> refers to the space between strips if you are printing multiple strips from one Spectrum Display.</p>
    <h3>Override Region</h3>
    <p>By default the image will contain the spectral region shown in the Spectrum Display. You can select to <span class="action">use [the] override region for printing</span> instead and enter your own preferred print region. You can choose to this either by setting minmum and maximum boundaries, or by setting a centre and width. If you wish to return to the values from the Spectrum Display, select one of the axes and click on <span class="action">Set Print Region/Min/Max/Centre/Width</span>. If you selected to print a full Spectrum Display containing several strips at the top of the print dialog, you can select override regions for each strip separately.</p>
    <h3>Scaling and Fonts</h3>
    <p>You can select to scale your image either relative to the page (percentage) or to use cm or inches per unit (Usually ppm, but could also be Hz) or by unit per cm or inches. You can also change the font and font size at this stage rather than doing it later in a graphics package.</p>
    <h3>Print Options</h3>
    <p>You can select to include or exclude particular Spectra or PeakLists, along with many of additional features. The images below show what these options translate into in the image. Some options are only relevant in particular situations, e.g. <span class="action">Spectrum Labels</span> are only relevant for images of stacked 1D spectra, <span class="action">Spectra on Phasing</span> for Spectrum Displays using the <span class="action">Phasing Console</span> and <span class="action">Integral Symbols / Labels</span> will only be listed if integrals are present in a spectrum in a Spectrum Display.</p>
