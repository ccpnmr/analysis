<h2>Quick Assignments</h2>
<p>You can make very quick assignments at any point by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> an NmrResidue or NmrAtom from the sidebar onto one or more selected peaks. If you have made a mistake, simply undo it with <span class="action">Ctrl + Z</span> (<span class="action">Cmd + Z</span> on a Mac) or drag a different NmrResidue/Atom onto the peak. If you wish, you can select multiple peaks in multiple spectra and/or displays and <span class="action">drag and drop</span> NmrResidues or NmrAtoms onto them all in one go - just make sure you do the drop on top of one of the peaks.</p>
<p>In some cases you may find that no assignment is made when dragging an NmrResidue onto a selected peak. This may occur when there is an ambiguity about which NmrAtoms in the NmrResidue should be associated with the peak. For example, a Trp residue contains a side-chain NH group (NE1/HE1) as well as the backbone NH group. In this case you need to drag the desired NmrAtoms onto the selected peak rather than the whole NmrResidue.</p>
<p>Note that if you have not selected any peaks, dragging an NmrResidue or NmrAtoms onto your display will place marks at the chemical shifts associated with the NmrResidue or NmrAtoms.</p>
<h3>Example: Quickly making assignments for an HSQC</h3>
<p>If the assignments for your protein's HSQC are already available, you can quickly add these to a spectrum in Analysis in the folowing way:</p>
<p>Load your HSQC spectrum by dragging it into the drop area. Peak pick the spectrum, e.g. by holding down <span class="action">Shift + Ctrl</span> (<span class="action">Shift + Cmd</span> on a Mac) while <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the mouse over all your peaks.
<br>Load your protein sequence by dropping a FASTA file into your project. Create a new NmrChain by opening up the <span class="action">NmrChains</span> in the sidebar and double-clicking on <span class="action">New NmrChain</span>. Select <span class="action">Clone from Chain</span> and select the Chain that was created when you loaded in your sequence. Now you have a new NmrChain containing your full protein sequence. You can then assign your HSQC directly, by selecting each peak and dragging the correct NmrResidues onto it.</p>
