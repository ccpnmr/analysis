<h2>Running Macros</h2>
<p>Open the Macro Editor by going to <span class="action">Macro / New</span>. You can now either start typing your macro into the editor or copy and paste a macro from the <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=14">Macros Forum</a>. Click on <span class="action">Run</span> to try running it and on <span class="action">Save</span> or <span class="action">Save As</span> to save the macro on your computer. You can specify the path where you want to save your macros in your Preferences: go to <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> (shortcut <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd+,</span>) and change your <span class="action">Macro Path</span> to a directory of your choice.</p>
<h3>User Shortcuts</h3>
<p>You can specify your own shortcut to run a macro (rather than having to open it in the <span class="action">Macro Editor</span> and click <span class="action">Run</span> every time!). Go to <span class="action">Macro / Define Macro Shortcuts...</span> (or type <span class="action">DU</span>). The keyboard shortcuts <span class="action">Q0-Q9</span>, <span class="action">W0-W9</span> and <span class="action">Y0-Y9</span> are reserved for user macros. Simply select the shortcut you would like to use and select your macro using the <span class="action">Gear Icon</span>, click <span class="action">Save</span> and your new shortcut should work.</p>
