    <h2>AnalysisScreen Hit Analysis Filtering</h2>
    <p>In the Hit Analysis module <span class="action">Settings</span> there is a <span class="action">Filters</span> tab which allows you to apply a large number of filtering options to your tables. Applying these will allow you to target specific areas of interest in your screening dataset, simplify the tables and also speed up the program.</p>
    <p>The <span class="action">Filters</span> panel has three main sections, corresponding to the Peak Binding Scores, Substances and Samples tables (see our <a href="ScreenHATables.html">Hit Analysis Tables page</a> for more information on these tables). Filters will only be applied when <span class="action">Matches, Substances</span> or <span class="action">Samples</span> are ticked. Use the <span class="action">&#62, &#62=, &#60, &#60=, ==</span> (equal) and <span class="action">!=</span> (not equal) signs to filter on a range of values, including Binding, Displacement and Matching Scores, Signal/Noise Ratio or Flags. You can also set a column by which to sort your table (by default this is descending, unless you tick the <span class="action">Ascending Sort</span> box). At the top of the panel you can restrict the table to show only the top X number of results.</p>
    <p>To apply the filtering, you need to press the <span class="action">Filtering</span> button (next to the <span class="action">Update</span> button) in the main part of the Hit Analysis module. If you make any changes to the Filters, the <span class="action">Update</span> button will go orange you will need to press it to re-apply the new Filters (the <span class="action">Update</span> button will then go green again).</p>
