    <h2>AnalysisScreen Pipelines</h2>
    <p>Pipelines can be used to carry out one or more actions on one or more spectra in one go. Open the <span class="action">Pipeline</span> module by going to the <span class="action">Screen</span> menu and selecting <span class="action">Screening Pipeline</span> or using the shortcut <span class="action">PI</span>.</p>
    <p>Drag the <span class="action">Spectra</span> or <span class="action">SpectrumGroups</span> that you want to use into the <span class="action">Input Data</span> box.</p>
    <p>You can build your pipeline from any of the individual pipes in the list of <span class="action">Pipes</span> below the <span class="action">Input Data</span>. Either drag a pipe into the <span class="action">Drop Pipes</span> area or double-click on a pipe and it will be added to the bottom of the list of pipes. You can also use the search box at the bottom of the list of pipes to search for a pipe and then drag/double-click it from the search results box. You can add multiple instances of a pipe to your pipelines, and you can rearrange your pipes by dragging them by their green header bar (similar to the way in which modules are dragged and dropped). Remove a pipe by pressing the cross on the right-hand side of the header bar, or right-click on the header bar and select <span class="action">Close</span> (or <span class="action">Close All</span> to remove all pipes in one go). For a description of what each pipe does and the effect of the settings, see our <a href="ScreenPipes.html">AnalysisScreen Pipes page</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have set all the options and settings in the pipes as you want them to be, you are ready to run your pipelines. Simply press on the green <span class="action">Play</span> button at the top of the pipeline.</p>
    <p>You can save your pipeline with all its settings if you wish (either for your own future use or for sharing with a colleague). Enter a <span class="action">Name</span> for your pipeline and then press the orange <span class="action">Save to Disk</span> button in the top right-hand corner of the module. Choose a directory and filename and save the pipeline (it will be saved as a .json file). If you wish to open a previously saved pipeline, press the blue <span class="action">Open</span> button and select the file.</p>
