<h2>Search Box</h2>
<p>The search box at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar lets you search for items in the sidebar. As you type a search string, possible matches are shown in a <span class="action">Search Results</span> box above. If you <span class="action">click</span> on a result line, then the sidebar will automatically navigate to that item, un-nesting any branches where necessary. You can also <span class="action">drag</span> an item from the <span class="action">Search Results</span> box into the drop area. This has the same effect as a normal drag from the sidebar, i.e. chemical shift lists or peak list are opened as tables and spectra are opened in spectrum display modules. Dropping NmrAtoms and NmrResidues into spectrum display modules will create marks at their respective chemical shifts, or if dropped onto peaks, the peaks will be assigned to the NmrAtoms/NmrResidues.</p>
<h3>Search Strings and Examples</h3>
<p>The search will look for any text matches and is case-insensitive. '*' can be used as a wildcard.</p>
<p>Note that every item of data in the sidebar is listed as a so-called <span class="action">Project ID</span>, or <span class="action">PID</span> for short. These PIDs contain a short code signify the data type (e.g. SP for spectrum - see below for a full list) </p>
<h3>PID Codes</h3>
<p>SP  Spectrum
<br>PL  Peak List
<br>NC  NmrChain</p>
