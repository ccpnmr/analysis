<h2>Setting up NmrResidues</h2>
<p>Setting up your NmrResidues is the first step required for the Backbone Assignment of a protein. We start the assignment process by assigning each peak in an HSQC or other base spectrum to NmrResidues and NmrAtoms which we use as placeholders until (over the course of the assignment process) we can assign them to actual residues and atoms. Go to <a href="NmrResidues.html">NmrResidues</a> for more information on how NmrResidues, NmrAtoms and NmrChains are used in Analysis.</p>
<p>Make sure all the peaks in your 2D (HSQC) base sepctrum have been picked, for example, by holding down <span class="action">Shift</span> and <span class="action">Ctrl</span> (<span class="action">Cmd</span> on a Mac) while <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the mouse over the complete spectrum area (go to <a href="PeakPicking.html">Peak Picking</a> for more information on peak picking).</p>
<p>Type <span class="action">SN</span> or go to <span class="action">Assign / Set up NmrResidues</span>. Select the (HSQC) peak list you want to use to set up your NmrResidues. Select the NmrChain you would like your NmrResidues to be added to. By default, this is the <span class="action">@-</span> chain. If you want to use a different NmrChain, you can create a new one, by opening up <span class="action">NmrChains</span> in the sidebar and <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on <span class="action">New NmrChain</span>. Then select <span class="action">Create New</span> (rather than <span class="action">Clone from</span>) and give your NmrChain a name. Once you have selected both your source peak list and your NmrChain you can click <span class="action">Okay</span> to set up your NmrResidues.</p>
<p>The program creates a set of NmrResidues and NmrAtoms in your chosen NmrChain. If you open your NmrChain in the sidebar you will now see that it contains all the NmrResidues and these in turn contain the NmrAtoms that have just been created. These are now your provisional atom names until you have managed to assign them. Any other peaks in other spectra which stem from the same nuclei can (or indeed should) be assigned to these same NmrAtoms.</p>
<p>Each peak has now also been given a peak label. Our base spectrum is generally a spectrum (such as an HSQC) in which the two atoms associated with each peak must be bonded to one another and belong to the same residue. Therefore, the two dimensions of each peak are labelled with the same NmrResidue (currently an arbitrary number preceeded by an <span class="action">@</span> symbol to indicate that this is a temporary number until we have made an assignment). But each dimension is assigned a different NmrAtom; in the case of an HSQC these are generally named either <span class="action">H</span> or <span class="action">N</span>. (The NmrAtom names are derived from the Axis Codes - change these in the <span class="action">Dimensions</span> tab of the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog, opend by <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on a spectrum in the sidebar.) Typically, the peak label is something like <span class="action">@63H, N</span>, meaning that the NmrResidue is <span class="action">@63</span> in both dimensions and the NmrAtom names in the two dimensions are <span class="action">H</span> and <span class="action">N</span>.</p>
<p>By default, all the peaks in an HSQC spectrum are given <span class="action">H</span> and <span class="action">N</span> atom names. Of course you are likely to have some peaks in your spectrum which derive from Asn, Gln or Trp side chains. You can change the atom names to <span class="action">HD2x/y</span>, <span class="action">ND2</span> etc. at any time. Simply <span class="action">double-click</span> on the NmrAtom in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Edit NmrAtom</span> diaglog box, choose a different atom name and click <span class="action">Apply</span> or <span class="action">Okay</span>.</p>
