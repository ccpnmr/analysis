    <h2>Signal / Noise</h2>
    <h3>Spectrum Noise Levels</h3>
    <p>Each spectrum has a noiseLevel (and a corresponding negativeNoiseLevel). When you first load a spectrum, we do a quick estimation of the noiseLevel which is used to set the initial contour level (the contourBase) of your spectrum. Generally the contourBase will be set to 1.41 times the noiseLevel. This allows fast loading of spectra and ensures your spectrum has a reasonable initial contour level when you first open it in a SpectrumDisplay. A full noise estimation would slow things down.</p>
    <p>If you want more accurate information about the noise in your spectrum, you can <span class="action">right-click</span> on your SpectrumDisplay and select <span class="action">Estimate Noise</span> (or use the shortcut <span class="action">EN</span>). This will bring up the <span class="action">Estimate Noise</span> pop-up which allows you to estimate the noise for all the spectra in the active SpectrumDisplay. You can estimate the noise either using the <span class="action">Visible Area</span> or <span class="action">Random Sampling</span> methods. You will get back information about the mean, standard deviation and min/max points of the noise sample used. The <span class="action">Estimated noise level</span> is set at 3.5 times the standard deviation of the noise. Assuming a Gaussian/Normal distribution of the noise, this should set your noiseLevel just above (or pretty much at the maximum value of) your noise.</p>
    <p>The pop-up allows you to re-estimate the noise if you wish and to set the spectrum noiseLevel to the <span class="action">Estimated noise level</span>.</p>
    <h4>Visible Area Method</h4>
    <p>This method will take all the points of the spectrum which are currently shown in the active SpectrumDisplay and use these to estimate the noise. This method assumes that the region shown only contains noise, so you first have to zoom into a part of the spectrum without any peaks before you bring up the <span class="action">Estimate Noise</span> pop-up.</p>
    <h4>Random Sampling Method</h4>
    <p>The <span class="action">Random Sampling</span> method will select a number of points in your spectrum to use for the noise estimation. Typically, a minimum of 3% of points per axis up to a maximum of 10,000 points are used. Of these points, lots of random subsets are chosen and used to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the noise. The subset with the lowest standard deviation is the final one used. This ensures that you are less likely to have accidentally included a real signal in your random sample.</p>
    <h3>Peak Signal / Noise</h3>
    <p>One of the values automatically calculated (and displayed in the peak list) for each peak is its signal / noise value (<span class="action">S/N</span>). This value makes use of the noiseLevel of the spectrum. Thus, if you would like an accurate estimate of peak signal / noise values, it would make sense to estimate the noise more accurately using <span class="action">EN</span> rather than rely on the quick estimate made when your spectrum is loaded.</p>
    <p>When considering peak signal / noise values, it is worth remembering that there are several ways of calculating the signal / noise value of a peak. One method is based on traditional signal theory where the signal to noise ratio is measured in terms of the square root of the fraction between the power of the signal intensity and the power of the noise intensity (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10858-012-9698-2">Hyberts et al. 2013</a>). This is typically how NMR spectrometers will measure the signal / noise. It is, however, somewhat dependent on the specifics of how you acqcuired your spectrum (e.g. sweep widths, carrier position, acquisition length, possible use of apodisation, probe shimming and tuning).</p>
    <p>Many NMR spectroscopists, however, define the signal / noise as:</p>
    <p>$$signal/noise = \frac{A}{\sigma_{noise}} $$</p>
    <p>where A is the height of the peak of interest and &sigma;<sub>noise</sub> is the standard deviation (also sometimes referred to as the root mean square or rms) of the noise. The advantage of using this definition is that it takes account of the fact that NMR spectroscopists typically work with signal averaging. When you double the number of scans, the signal will double, but the noise will only increase with by a factor of &#8730;2. Thus, by using this definition of signal / noise, a doubling of scans leads to an incrase in the signal / noise value of &#8730;2 which is a convenient relationship. <span class="action">It is this definition of signal / noise which we have started using from Version 3.2.1 onwards.</span></p>
    <p>Previously, we used the equation used by Varian:</p>
    <p>$$signal/noise =\frac{2.5A}{N_{pp}}$$</p>
    <p>where A is the peak height and N<sub>pp</sub> is the peak-to-peak noise, i.e. the full spread of the noise from the mninimum to the maximum signal in the noise region. We approximated N<sub>pp</sub> to 2 * noiseLevel, i.e. 7 * &sigma;<sub>noise</sub> (unless you had manually changed the noiseLevel yourself, of course).</p>
    <p>Note that the equation used by Bruker is:</p>
    <p>$$signal/noise =\frac{A}{2 \cdot noise}$$</p>
    <p>where A is again the peak height and:</p>
    <p>$$noise=\sqrt{\frac{ \sum_{i=-n}^{n}y(i)^2 -\frac{1}{N} \left( \left( \sum_{i=-n}^{n}y(i)\right)^2+\frac{3\cdot\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}i(y(i)-y(-i))\right)^2}{N^2-1}\right)}{N-1}}$$</p>
    <p>and N is the total number of points in the noise region, n = (N-1)/2 and y(i) is the n<sup>th</sup> point in the noise region.</p>
