<h2>Transferring Assignments</h2>
<p>Here are several ways for you to transfer assignments from one spectrum to another. This may be relevant to you, if you have imported chemical shifts from the BMRB and created a peak list (see the <a href="BMRBImport.html">BMRB Import tutorial</a> on how to do this) which you want to use as the basis for the peak list in the spectrum you recorded. Or you may have two spectra recorded under different conditions (e.g. with/without ligand, different temperature, buffer etc.) which means at least some of your peaks have moved and now you want to transfer the assignments from one spectrum to another.</p>
<h3>Copying a peak list and moving the peaks</h3>
<p>You can copy a peak list from one spectrum to another (as long as the axes match) by <span class="action">dragging</span> a peak list from the sidebar and dropping it onto a spectrum in a spectrum display module. A pop-up will ask you to confirm the peak list you are copying and the target spectrum you are copying it to. It also provides you with options to refit the peaks if you would like. The peaks will then be copied into a new peak list belonging to the target spectrum. Now you can move the peaks to the new correct peak positions by <span class="action">dragging</span> the peaks with the <span class="action">middle mouse button</span>. It is then also worth making sure the peaks are in the correct position using <span class="action">SE</span> (snap to extremum) or <span class="action">RP</span> (re-fit peak with a Gaussian fit - unless you have changed this to a parabolic fit in your <span class="action">Preferences</span>).</p>
<p>This method of transferring your peak assignments is particularly suited to situations where your peaks have either not moved by very much, or only a few peaks have moved.</p>
<h3>Copy/Propagate assignments between selected Peaks</h3>
<p>You can copy assignments between selected peaks using <span class="action">Assign / Propagate Assignments</span> (shortcut <span class="action">PG</span>) or <span class="action">Assign / Copy Assignments</span> (shortcut <span class="action">CA</span>). In both cases the assignments are swapped between all selected peaks. <span class="action">Propagate Assignments</span> will only copy the assignments if the peak positions are within the Spectrum Assignment Tolerances. <span class="action">Copy Assignments</span> will copy the assignments regardless of Assignment Tolerances. For more information see our <a href="PropagateAndCopyAssignments.html">Propagate and Copy Assignments webpage</a> </p>
<p>This method of transferring peak assignments is  useful for transferring assignments to a whole strip of peaks in a 3D spectrum. <span class="action">Copy Assignments</span> is also well suited to situations in which there are many large differences in peak positions and moving many peaks with the middle-mouse button can become a bit fiddly and tedious.</p>
<h3>Dragging NmrResidues or NmrAtoms from the sidebar</h3>
<p>You can also make assignments by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> an NmrResidue or NmrAtom from the sidebar onto one or more selected peaks. This could be useful if you want to make assignments based on a printout or table rather than data that you already have in your project. If you have made a mistake, simply undo it with <span class="action">Ctrl + Z</span> (<span class="action">Cmd + Z</span> on a Mac). If you drag an additional NmrResidue/Atom onto the peak, that assignment will be added, too. If you wish, you can select multiple peaks in multiple spectra and/or displays and <span class="action">drag and drop</span> NmrResidues or NmrAtoms onto them all in one go - just make sure you do the drop on top of one of the peaks.</p>
<p>If you drag and drop an NmrResidue or multiple NmrAtoms which contain multiple NmrAtoms of the same isotope type, then you will be presented with a little pop-up box where you can select exactly which NmrAtoms you wish to assign to the peak(s).</p>
<p>Note that if you have not selected any peaks, dragging an NmrResidue or NmrAtoms onto your display will place marks at the chemical shifts associated with the NmrResidue or NmrAtoms. If the NmrAtoms have several different chemical shifts in different Chemical Shift Lists, then all of the chemical shifts will be marked.</p>
