    <h2>Using the Peak Assigner</h2>
    <h4>Note that this is new for Version 3.1 - in Version 3.0 the Peak Assigner is different</h4>
    <p>The <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> module is a useful tool for making and editing your peak assignments. Open it by going to <span class="action">Assign / Peak Assigner</span> or using the shortcut <span class="action">AP</span>.</p>
    <p>The <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> is arranged in columns - one for each dimension of your spectrum. The Axis Code (usually <span class="action">H</span>, <span class="action">N</span>, <span class="action">CO</span> or similar) and peak position are provided at the top of each column. Each column contains two panels: the top one contains the NmrAtoms which have been assigned to that peak dimension and the lower panel contains <span class="action">Alternatives</span>, i.e. NmrAtoms which have a similar chemical shift and might be likely assignment candidates. <span class="action">Double-clicking</span> on an NmrAtom in the lower panel will assign it to the peak and the NmrAtom will move to the upper panel. <span class="action">Double-clicking</span> on an NmrAtom in the upper panel will deassign it from the peak and move it to the lower panel. </p>
    <p>You can also create a new NmrAtom or directly type in the details of an existing NmrAtom that doesn't appear in the <span class="action">Alternatives</span> box (perhaps because its chemical shift is outside the tolerance limits for that spectrum) by clicking on the <span class="action">New</span> button or <span class="action">right-clicking</span> in the top panel and selecting <span class="action">New nmrAtom</span>. A small pop-up box will appear at your mouse position and you can enter the NmrAtom's <span class="action">Chain</span>, <span class="action">Sequence Code</span>, <span class="action">Residue Type</span> (optional) and <span class="action">Atom Name</span>. You can use <span class="action">Tab</span> to move easily from one box to another. Press <span class="action">Enter</span> or the <span class="action">Accept</span> button to assign the NmrAtom to the peak. If you want to cancel, simply click anywhere outside the pop-up box and it will disappear.</p>
    <p>If you wish to edit an NmrAtom in the <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> simply select the NmrAtom you wish to edit and press the <span class="action">Edit</span> button or <span class="action">right-click</span> and select <span class="action">Edit NmrAtom X</span>. Enter any changes into the pop-up box and then click the <span class="action">Accept</span> button in the pop-up or press the <span class="action">Enter</span> key on your keyboard.</p>
