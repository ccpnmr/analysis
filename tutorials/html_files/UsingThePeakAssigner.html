    <h2>Using the Peak Assigner</h2>
    <h4>Note that this is new for Version 3.1 - in Version 3.0 the Peak Assigner is different</h4>
    <p>The <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> module is a useful tool for making and editing your peak assignments. Open it by going to <span class="action">Assign / Peak Assigner</span> or using the shortcut <span class="action">AP</span>.</p>
    <p>The <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> is arranged in columns - one for each dimension of your spectrum. The Axis Code (usually <span class="action">H</span>, <span class="action">N</span>, <span class="action">CO</span> or similar) and peak position are provided at the top of each column. Each column contains two panels: the top one contains the NmrAtoms which have been assigned to that peak dimension and the lower panel contains <span class="action">Alternatives</span>, i.e. NmrAtoms which have a similar chemical shift and might be likely assignment candidates. <span class="action">Double-clicking</span> on an NmrAtom in the lower panel will assign it to the peak and the NmrAtom will move to the upper panel. <span class="action">Double-clicking</span> on an NmrAtom in the upper panel will deassign it from the peak and move it to the lower panel. </p>
    <p>You can also create a new NmrAtom or directly type in the details of an existing NmrAtom that doesn't appear in the <span class="action">Alternatives</span> box (perhaps because its chemical shift is outside the tolerance limits for that spectrum) by clicking on the <span class="action">New</span> button or <span class="action">right-clicking</span> in the top panel and selecting <span class="action">New nmrAtom</span>. A small pop-up box will appear at your mouse position and you can enter the NmrAtom's <span class="action">Chain</span>, <span class="action">Sequence Code</span>, <span class="action">Residue Type</span> (optional) and <span class="action">Atom Name</span>. You can use <span class="action">Tab</span> to move easily from one box to another. Press <span class="action">Enter</span> or the <span class="action">Accept</span> button to assign the NmrAtom to the peak. If you want to cancel, simply click anywhere outside the pop-up box, and it will disappear.</p>
    <p>If you wish to edit an NmrAtom in the <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> simply select the NmrAtom you wish to edit and press the <span class="action">Edit</span> button or <span class="action">right-click</span> and select <span class="action">Edit NmrAtom X</span>. Enter any changes into the pop-up box and then click the <span class="action">Accept</span> button in the pop-up or press the <span class="action">Enter</span> key on your keyboard. Click outside the pop-up box to cancel making any changes.</p>
    <h3>Assigning multiple peaks in one go</h3>
    <p>It is possible to assign multiple peaks in one go using the <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span>. If you have multiple peaks which are roughly at the same position (i.e. within the spectrum tolerances) you can select all of these and assign them in one go. The peaks may belong to the same or different spectra, though they must have the same number of dimensions with the same IsotopeCodes. You can also assign multiple peaks which only match in one or two dimensions. So in a triple resonance (HNC) experiment, for example, you could select all the peaks in one NH strip which are at different carbon positions. The <span class="action">Peak Assigner</span> will let you assign the NH dimensions for all the peaks in one go. For the carbon dimension (where the peaks diverge and do not overlap) it will not show the assignment panels, but show the message <span class="action">C: peaks not aligned</span> instead.</p>
