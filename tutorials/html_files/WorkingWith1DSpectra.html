<h2>Working with 1D spectra</h2>
    <p>Working with 1D spectra is much the same as working with ND spectra. You can zoom in on the spectrum with the <span class="action">mouse wheel</span>, zoom either axis selectively by using the <span class="action">mouse wheel</span> on the axis and move the spectrum around with <span class="action">left-drag</span>. The Zoom buttons on the toolbar can be a useful way to exapnd the X and or Y axis to their full limits. <span class="action">Shift + left-drag</span> will zoom in on a region, <span class="action">Shift + Ctrl</span> (<span class="action">Cmd</span> on a Mac) <span class="action">+ left-drag</span> will pick peaks and <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd + left-drag</span> will select/deselect peaks. Note that in order to pick a peak you must drag the mouse over the peak maximum/minimum, not just across its base. Alternatively place a peak with <span class="action">Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + left-click</span>. Use <span class="action">right-click / New Multiplet</span> or shortcut <span class="action">AM</span> to group selected peaks into a multiplet.</p>
    <h3>Stacking Spectra</h3>
    <p>You can stack your spectra by going to <span class="action">right-click / Stack Spectra</span> or using the shortcut <span class="action">SK</span>. Increase or decrease the distance between the spectra by changing the <span class="action">Y offset</span> at the bottom of the Spectrum Display. Add a slant by changing the <span class="action">X offset</span>. </p>
    <h3>Integrating Peaks</h3>
    <p>You can integrate a peak by selecting it with <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd + left-click</span> and then going to <span class="action">right-click / Integrate Peak</span>. A small region will be highlighted. <span class="action">Left-drag</span> the edges to increase/decrease the region or <span class="action">left-drag</span> the centre of the region to move it until it spans the full region over which you wish to calculate the integral. The integral value is shown on the display. A new <span class="action">Integral List</span> will also have been created and nested below the corresponding spectrum in the sidebar. If you open this (<span class="action">left-drag</span> into the drop-area or <span class="action">right-click / Open as Module</span>), you will see the integral in the list, showing its bounds and the integral value. The values are updated in realtime as you change the integral bounds. Integrals are shown as coloured regions in the spectrum. To change the colour, <span class="action">double-click</span> on your integral list and select a different <span class="action">Symbol Colour</span> .</p>
