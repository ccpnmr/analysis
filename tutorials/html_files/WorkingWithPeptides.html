    <h2>Working with Peptides</h2>
    <p>CcpNmr Analysis contains several features which should make life easier for people working with peptides.</p>

    <h3>Multiplets</h3>
    <p>Peptide spectra often contain undecoupled peaks which are split into multiplets. Find out about our <a href="Multiplets.html">Multiplets feature</a> to see how you can group your peaks into multiplets. This way, the Chemical Shift reported in your Chemical Shift List will always be at the centre of the multiplet and you won't have to place an artificial placeholder peak between the two actual multiplet components as a surrogate.</p>
    <p>We have also introduced a 2D multiplet peak picker. If you go to <span class="action">File / Preferences</span> and then go to the <span class="action">Peaks</span> tab, you can set your <span class="action">Default nD peak picker</span> to <span class="action">PeakPicker2DMultiplets</span>. This will act exactly the same as our normal <span class="action">PeakPickerNd</span> peak picker, but for 2D spectra it will automatically group close peaks into multiplets.</p>

    <h3>Working with non-canonical Amino Acids</h3>
    <p>This is a common occurrence for people working with peptides. In principle, if you are simply assigning your protein, you can just go ahead and create the NmrResidues and NmrAtoms that you need as you want. The <span class="action">ResidueType</span> box can be set to anything, so you can give your residue a different name. Similarly, the <span class="action">AtomName</span> can be set to anything, so as long as you know what each atom in your non-canonical amino acid is called, you can name these as you wish.</p>
    <p>You may decide that you would like to have not only an NmrChain, but also a Chain of your peptide in your project. This would, for example, allow you to create all possible NmrAtoms from the Chain very easily. And if you are going to be doing structure calculations you will need a Chain, too. In order to add a non-canonical amino acid to your Chain, you need to have a ChemComp .xml file for this amino acid. This is a file which contains all the information about the atoms: their names, how they are bonded to one another, possible differences in protonation state, magnetically equivalent groups, prochiral atoms, where/how the amino acid is linked to neighbouring amino acids in a chain etc. Find out about how to access existing ChemComp files for non-canonical amino acids or create your own on our <a href="CreatingNoncanonicalAAChemComps.html">Creating Non-canonical Amino Acid ChemComps page</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have your ChemComp file you will then need to add it to your project and create your Chain using so-called ccpCodes rather than the standard 1-letter amino acid code. Have a look at our <a href="CreatingChainsWithNoncanonicalAAs.html">Creating Chains with non-canonical Amino Acids page</a> to find out how you can do this.</p>

    <h3 id="RefChemShifts">Reference Chemical Shifts</h3>
    <p>If you are not so familiar with the average Chemical Shift values for the standard amino acids, you can easily look these up at <span class="action">Main Menu / Molecules / Reference Chemical Shifts</span> (or shortcut <span class="action">RC</span>) and correlate the Reference Chemical Shifts with the mouse cross-hairs in your spectra. Have a look at our <a href="ReferenceChemicalShifts.html">Reference Chemical Shifts webpage</a> for more information.</p>
    <p>In addition, we have created a <a href="https://ccpn.le.ac.uk/download/ccpnmr/RefChemShifts.nef">NEF file containing a 20-amino acid chain with all the Reference Chemical Shifts</a>. You can import this into your project and then use this to create marks on your spectrum by dragging one of the NmrResidues/NmrAtoms onto a SpectrumDisplay.</p>
    <p>You can also use the <a href="https://ccpn.le.ac.uk/download/ccpnmr/RefChemShifts.nef">NEF file containing a 20-amino acid chain with all the Reference Chemical Shifts</a> in conjunction with the <a href="#PeaksFromNRs">peaksFromNmrResidue </a> macro introduced below to create a set of peaks at the Reference Chemical Shift positions which you can then easily move onto the actual peak positions in your spectrum.</p>

    <h3 id="PeaksFromNRs">Creating Peaks from NmrResidues</h3>
    <p>Much of the information in peptide spectra is redundant which means that you will not need all peaks or spectra to assign the atoms in a residue. However, once the atoms have been assigned, it is helpful to label (assign) all the peaks belonging to these atoms. Then you will know that these peaks are assigned, even if they were not used as part of the assignment process. A CCPN macro called <span class="action">peaksFromNmrResidues</span> can help you label all these remaining peaks.</p>
    <p>You can also use this macro in conjunction with the downloadable <a href="https://ccpn.le.ac.uk/download/ccpnmr/RefChemShifts.nef">NEF file containing a 20-amino acid chain with all the Reference Chemical Shifts</a> to place peaks at the average chemical shift positions for a particular amino acid. Then you can manually move them into the correct place for your spectrum.</p>
    <p>For more information about this macro, including a video, see the <a href="PeaksFromNmrResiduesMacro.html">Peaks from NmrResidues macro webpage</a>.</p>

    <h3>Creating a structure calculation PeakList from a Noesy spectrum with multiplets</h3>
    <p>When conducting structure calculations you generally need to provide the structure calculation program with a Noesy Peak List and a matching Chemical Shift List. However, if your Noesy spectrum contains multiplets (which may well be the case when working with unlabelled peptides), then the peaks in your Noesy spectrum (which are the multiplet components) won't match the Chemical Shifts in the Chemical Shift List (which match the centre of the multiplet). In addition, you may have some peaks which are split into multiplets and others which are not. Our <a href="CreateNoesyPeakListFromMultiplets.html">CreateNoesyPeakListFromMultiplets macro</a> will take your Noesy PeakList and create from it a new PeakList in which any peaks belonging to multiplets are replaced by peaks located at the multiplet centre and for which the heights and volumes are the sum of the heights and volumes of the  component peaks of the multiplet. This PeakList can now be used together with a ChemicalShiftList to run a structure calculation.</p>
