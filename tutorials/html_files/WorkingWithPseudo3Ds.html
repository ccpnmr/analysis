    <h2>Working with Pseudo3Ds</h2>
    <p>You can open a pseudo 3D spectrum like any other spectrum - simply drag it into the program, or use <span class="action">Spectrum / Load Spectra...</span>. Analysis will treat your pseudo 3D spectrum as a regular 3D spectrum with a time dimension axis. When you open it in a SpectrumDisplay module, the module will probably be called something like <span class="action">3D_HNT</span> where <span class="action">H</span> and <span class="action">N</span> refer to 1H and 15N axes and <span class="action">T</span> to a time dimension axis. Be default, the time dimension axis is placed in the z-dimension. You can scroll through the different planes to inspect them, but because the spectrum is being treated as a 3D, you won't be able to pick peaks in each plane. Any peaks you pick will be treated as 3D peaks and their position will depend on the intensities in the time dimension axis (you will be able to see this if you flip the y and z axes with <span class="action">YZ</span>).</p>
    <p>In order to pick 2D peaks in each of your planes, you will need to split your pseudo-3D into 2Ds. [Still need to finalise and explain how to do this...]</p>
    <p>Once you have your individual planes in a SpectrumGroup, you can <span class="action">double-click</span> on the SpectrumGroup in the sidebar to set various parameters. In the <span class="action">Series</span> tab, for instance, you can set your time domain values (which are often not available from the raw spectrum data) and reorder your spectra. You can then select all the spectra in the spectrum group and open them in a SpectrumDisplay by <span class="action">dragging</span> them into the <span class="action">Drop Area</span>. By using <span class="action">Tab, Tab</span> you can cycle through the different spectra/planes in turn to inspect, peak pick etc. (Remember that <span class="action">Tab+A</span> will show all spectra in a SpectrumDisplay and <span class="action">Tab+Z</span> with switch them all off.)</p>
