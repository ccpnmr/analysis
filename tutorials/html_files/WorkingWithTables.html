<h2>Wroking with Tables</h2>
<p>There are many different data sets in Analysis which can be viewed in tables, e.g. peak lists, chemical shift lists, NmrResidues, residues, multiplets, integrals, structures etc. These tables can be displayed by selecting them from the <span class="action">View</span> menu, typing their keyboard shortcut or dragging them into the drop area from the sidebar. The tables share many general characteristics:</p>
<p>A dropdown menu at the top lets you select the dataset, e.g. which peak list, NmrChain etc. you want to view.</p>
<p>Columns which have a small pen in their header are editable. <span class="action">Double-click</span> in a cell and then you can edit it.</p>
<p><span class="action">Right-click</span> on a column heading to select <span class="action">Column Settings...</span> where you can select which columns to hide or show in your table.</p>
<p><span class="action">Right-click</span> on a column heading to go to the <span class="action">Search</span> function. This generally operates on all cells visible in the table. This means repeated searches without clicking <span class="action">Reset</span> in between will refine your search. Clicking <span class="action">Reset</span> brings back the full table.</p>
<p><span class="action">Right-clicking</span> in the table will enable you to export the table, either <span class="action">Export Visible Table</span> to export only those columns and rows which are currently being shown, or <span class="action">Export All</span> to export the full table. The supported export file formats include Excel (.xlsx), comma separated (.csv) and tab separated (.tsv) files.</p>
