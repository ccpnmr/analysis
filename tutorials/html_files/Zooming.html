<h2>Zooming</h2>
<p>You can zoom in and out by <span class="action">scrolling the mouse wheel</span>, by typing <span class="action">ZI</span> or <span class="action">ZO</span>, or by using the <span class="action">+ / -</span> keys (you don't have to press <span class="action">Shift</span> to use the <span class="action">+</span> key, so strictly speaking, it is <span class="action">=</span> rather than <span class="action">+</span>!). You can set the zoom to be centred either on the mouse position or on the centre of the display by going to <span class="action">Project /Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>) and making your selection in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab.</p>
<p>To zoom in on a particular area, hold down <span class="action">Shift</span> while <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the mouse over the area of interest. A yellow box will illustrate the selected area.</p>
<p>Revert to a full spectrum (maximum) zoom level by clicking on the <span class="action">Maximise Zoom</span> button in the toolbar.</p>
<h3>Aspect Ratio</h3>
<p>The aspect ratio of your spectrum is changed by <span class="action">scrolling the mouse wheel</span> on one of the axes. This selectively zooms that axis, thereby, in effect, changing the aspect ratio. You can lock the aspect ratio by clicking on <span class="action">LOCK</span> in the bottom left-hand corner of the spectrum display. Note that if you have the aspect ratio lock turned on and you then do an area zoom with the mouse, you will temporarily change the aspect ratio to suit the area you have zoomed in on. <span class="action">Scroll the mouse wheel</span> on an axis to return to your locked aspect ratio or <span class="action">scroll the mouse wheel</span> in the display to maintain the new aspect ratio temporarily.</p>
<h3>Stored Zooms</h3>
<p>You can store a particular zoom level using the <span class="action">Store Zoom</span> button in the toolbar, or typing <span class="action">ZS</span>. To revert to this stored zoom level either press the <span class="action">Restore Zoom</span> button in the toolbar or type <span class="action">ZR</span>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to move to the zoom setting you last used with the <span class="action">Previous Zoom</span> button in the toolbar or by typing <span class="action">ZP</span>. Similarly you can then move forwards to the next zoom level again with <span class="action">Next Zoom</span> or <span class="action">ZN</span>.</p>
